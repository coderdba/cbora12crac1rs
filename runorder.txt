0. Comment out run-list of both nodes, and do vagrant up for each node
    0a. vagrant up rac1n1
    0b. vagrant up rac1n2

00. Change password of 'oracle' user to 'oracle'
--> Logon to each node by doing vagrant ssh nodename
--> sudo to root
--> run 'passwd oracle' and enter new password as oracle itself

Note: The machine itself comes with two groups and a user:
uid=54321(oracle) gid=54321(oinstall) groups=54321(oinstall),54322(dba)
--> And, vagrant uses uid 54322
--> Retain them, add 'create' blocks in users_and_groups - it will add if not there ...

1. rac1n1 - 'recipe[cbora12crac1::users_and_groups]'
1a. rac1n1 - logon and change password of 'oracle' user to 'oracle' (or as in attributes/default.rb)
1b. rac1n1 - logon and change password of 'grid' user to 'oracle' (or as in attributes/default.rb)
1c. rac1n1 - set firewall off (service firewalld stop) - TBD in cookbook
2. rac1n2 - 'recipe[cbora12crac1::users_and_groups]'
2a. rac1n2 - logon and change password of 'oracle' user to 'oracle' (or as in attributes/default.rb)
2b. rac1n2 - logon and change password of 'grid' user to 'oracle' (or as in attributes/default.rb)
2c. rac1n2 - set firewall off (service firewalld stop) - TBD in cookbook

10. rac1n1 - 'recipe[cbora12crac1::configure_oracleasm]','recipe[cbora12crac1::prepare_asm_disks]'

11. not needed??as configure_oracleasm does both nodes:
      rac1n2 - 'recipe[cbora12crac1::configure_oracleasm]'

12a. rac1n1 - set ownership of /dev/sdb etc to grid:oinstall
12b. rac1n1 - set the permission permanently in /etc/rc.d
13a. rac1n2 - set ownership of /dev/sdb etc to grid:oinstall
13b. rac1n2 - set the permission permanently in /etc/rc.d

TO INSTALL GRID SOFTWARE:
On rac1n1 :
Logon/sudo to 'grid' user
cp /vagrant/grid_install.rsp /tmp/grid_install.rsp
cd /stage-grid (which is a shared folder with laptop)
nohup ./runInstaller -silent -responseFile /tmp/grid_install.rsp -showProgress -ignorePrereq > 1.out 2>> 1.out &
